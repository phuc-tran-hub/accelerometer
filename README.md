# accelerometer

In this project, I developed a tilt detection system using an accelerometer. By tilting the sensor, I observed the gravity vector's projection onto the x, y, and z axes, allowing me to compute the tilt angle using the formula 𝜃 = atan2(𝐴𝑥,𝐴𝑦). This approach ensured accurate angle localization across the full 360° range. I implemented floating-point arithmetic to achieve precise calculations and included the necessary library for trigonometric functions. My program displayed the acceleration components and tilt angle, converting the computed tilt from radians to degrees and formatting it appropriately for output on a seven-segment display. To validate my tilt meter, I compared its readings with a three-axis accelerometer app on my phone. I calibrated the meter by adjusting the breakout board until the readings aligned, allowing for an accurate tilt comparison. Additionally, I created a simulated image orientation feature by incorporating four LEDs to represent the breadboard's orientation in both portrait and landscape modes based on the tilt data. For extra credit, I calculated three angles that represent the accelerometer's orientation in space, ensuring careful attention to the signs of the results. I presented my designs to an instructor for evaluation, showcasing the project's functionality and accuracy.
